# Movies_ETL

## Project Overview
* Amazing Prime is looking for information on low budget films that they can potentially invest in with hopes they they will find the next hit. The purpose of this analysis is to take movie data from Wikipedia and Kaggle as well as ratings data from MovieLens and create data tables in PostgreSQL for Amazing Prime. We will then automate the pipeline that regularly takes incoming film data, makes necessary transformations to it and loads it into existing the data tables for their review. After the inital cleaning, transformation and extraction, the initial data sets are composed of 6,052 movies and 26,024,289 individual film ratings. 

## Resources
* Data source: movies_metadata.csv, ratings.csv, wikipedia-movies.json
* Software: Python 3.9.12, Jupyter Notebook 3.1, PostgreSQL 11.16
